# AutoProspector
This is a script meant to automate the tedious task of emailing eBay listing information pulled from an exported watch list (CSV file) from Moxy Proxie Prospector. Most will find this useless, but it makes my job easier. 

USAGE
To use this script, change the gmail_user variable on line 9 to the email account you intend to send emails from. 
Then, change the gmail_password variable on line 10 to that account's password.
Finally, change the recipient variable on line 27 to whatever account you want to send emails to.

In case you can't tell, I haven't yet learned proper documentation techniques.

I should change that at some point.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
